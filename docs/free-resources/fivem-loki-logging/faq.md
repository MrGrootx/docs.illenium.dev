### I don't understand how to query my logs. Any guides?

See docs on [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/)

### Can I run this on Windows?

No.

### Can I run this on an existing Linux VM / VPS?

You can but there are no guarantees if it will work or not. I will NOT be responsible if your VPS is affected while attempting to install it. It is highly recommended to setup a new VM / VPS just for this setup.

No.
